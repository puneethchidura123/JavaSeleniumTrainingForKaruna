loops : when we wanted to do a repeated execution based on a conditon/s the loops is the best idea



1)For Loop
2) While Loop
3) Do while Loop
4) For each OR enhanced for loop  : we shall discuss this after arrays. 



For Loop :


for(initialization;condition;increment/decrement)
{

// body of the loop

}





break  :  this is used to stop the executon of the loop

continue :
// to print numbers from 1 to 20

for(int i =1;i<=20;i++)
{
sysout(i);
} 




while loop :


this is an entry controlled loop. first condition is checked and if the condition is passed then loop body is executed
while(condition)
{
//body of the loop
}



do while loop :


this is an exit controlled loop. first the body of the loop is executed then the conditon is evaluated. if the condition is passed the the loop body will repeat


do
{
// body of the loop
}while(condition);
